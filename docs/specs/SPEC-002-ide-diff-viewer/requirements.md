# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the worktree comparison workflow by integrating IntelliJ's native diff viewer instead of displaying raw Git CLI output. Currently, when users compare two worktrees, the plugin shows the diff output in a plain text dialog (DiffResultDialog), which lacks IDE features like syntax highlighting, side-by-side comparison, navigation, and merge assistance. By leveraging the IntelliJ Platform's DiffManager and related APIs, users will get a familiar, feature-rich diff experience that matches the IDE's standard VCS diff functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Display Worktree Comparison in IDE Diff Viewer

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want to see worktree comparisons in IntelliJ's native diff viewer, so that I can leverage familiar IDE features like syntax highlighting, side-by-side comparison, and navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Compare Worktrees" and chooses two worktrees THEN the system SHALL display the comparison results using IntelliJ's DiffManager instead of the DiffResultDialog.
2. WHEN the diff viewer is opened THEN the system SHALL show a side-by-side comparison for each changed file between the two worktrees.
3. WHEN multiple files have changes THEN the system SHALL present all changed files in a navigable list or tree structure within the diff viewer.
4. WHEN no differences exist between worktrees THEN the system SHALL display an informational message using Messages.showInfoMessage.

### Requirement 2: Preserve File-Level Diff Context

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want to see which files changed between worktrees and navigate between them, so that I can efficiently review all differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the diff viewer displays multiple changed files THEN the system SHALL provide a file tree or list showing all modified files.
2. WHEN the user clicks on a file in the list THEN the system SHALL display that file's diff in the main viewer pane.
3. WHEN viewing a file diff THEN the system SHALL show the file path and worktree names in the diff viewer title or header.
4. WHEN the user navigates between files THEN the system SHALL preserve the current scroll position and state of previously viewed files.

### Requirement 3: Support IDE Diff Viewer Features

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want access to standard IDE diff features like syntax highlighting and navigation, so that I can review code changes more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying file diffs THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting based on the file type.
2. WHEN the diff viewer is open THEN the system SHALL provide navigation controls to move between changes (next/previous difference).
3. WHEN viewing diffs THEN the system SHALL support the IDE's standard diff viewer keyboard shortcuts.
4. WHEN the diff viewer is displayed THEN the system SHALL show line numbers for both versions of the file.

### Requirement 4: Handle Diff Viewer Errors Gracefully

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want clear error messages when diff viewing fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fails to retrieve file content for diff viewing THEN the system SHALL display an error notification with details about which file failed.
2. WHEN the system encounters an error opening the diff viewer THEN the system SHALL fall back to showing an error dialog with actionable guidance.
3. WHEN a worktree has uncommitted changes THEN the system SHALL continue to show the existing error message before attempting to open the diff viewer.
4. WHEN the diff viewer cannot be opened due to missing files THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message indicating which files are missing.

### Requirement 5: Maintain Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want the comparison workflow to continue working as expected, so that existing functionality is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates a worktree comparison THEN the system SHALL continue to validate that both worktrees exist and have no uncommitted changes.
2. WHEN the comparison is initiated THEN the system SHALL continue to use the existing CompareWorktreesDialog for worktree selection.
3. WHEN the comparison completes successfully THEN the system SHALL open the IDE diff viewer instead of the DiffResultDialog.
4. WHEN the user cancels the worktree selection dialog THEN the system SHALL not proceed with the comparison.

### Requirement 6: Optimize Performance for Large Diffs

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want worktree comparisons to remain responsive even with many changed files, so that the IDE doesn't freeze or become sluggish.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing worktrees with many changed files THEN the system SHALL load and display the diff viewer without blocking the EDT.
2. WHEN retrieving file content for diffs THEN the system SHALL perform I/O operations on background threads.
3. WHEN the diff viewer is loading THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator to the user.
4. WHEN file content retrieval takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL allow the user to cancel the operation.
